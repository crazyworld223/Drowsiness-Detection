# Drowsiness-Detection
In this project I have used several libraries like OpenCV, Pygame , Tensorflow , Keras 
This project mainly focuses on providing an alert system to the drivers when they fall asleep during driving
The main purpose of this project is to minimise number of accidents that occour while falling asleep
